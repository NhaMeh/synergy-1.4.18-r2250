//! Mutual exclusion
/*!
A non-recursive mutual exclusion object.  Only one thread at a time can
hold a lock on a mutex.  Any thread that attempts to lock a locked mutex
will block until the mutex is unlocked.  At that time, if any threads are
blocked, exactly one waiting thread will acquire the lock and continue
running.  A thread may not lock a mutex it already owns the lock on;  if
it tries it will deadlock itself.
