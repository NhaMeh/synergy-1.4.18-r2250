	The hot key is pressed when the hot key's modifiers and only those
	modifiers are logically down (active) and the key is pressed.  The hot
	key is released when the key is released, regardless of the modifiers.

	has the focus.  No other window or application should receive the key
	press or release events (they can and should see the modifier key events).
