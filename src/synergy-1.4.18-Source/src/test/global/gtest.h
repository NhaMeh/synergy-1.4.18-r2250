// HACK: gcc on osx106 doesn't give you an easy way to hide warnings
// from included headers, so use the system_header pragma. the downside
// is that everything in the header file following this also has warnings
// ignored, so we need to put it in a separate header file.

// gtest has a warning on osx106 (signed/unsigned int compare).
